		<div id="classtitle"> <h2> Course Description </h2> </div>
		<div id="classblock">
			<p>Currently, most robots are programmed meticulously by robotics experts in a controlled laboratory setting—a model that is obviously not scalable to large-scale deployment.  Robot learning from demonstration has emerged as an alternative paradigm for teaching robots new tasks by simply showing them what to do, rather than by writing code.  Thus, learning from demonstration research tries to answer the question: “How can robots learn to interpret and generalize human demonstrations?”  Solving this core research problem will enable the next generation of personal robots to revolutionize the home and workplace in coming years. <br>
			<br>
			This research stream will place students at the cutting-edge of robot learning from demonstration research, working with robots to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as autonomously building IKEA furniture.   Students will be given instruction in three core areas of robotics: manipulation, perception, and human-robot interaction.  Additionally, students will learn and practice programming skills via hands-on mini-projects in each of these areas. After these key competencies have been acquired, students will devise and implement research projects in the area of learning from demonstration.</p>

			<p>
				This course is the continuation of the FRI Robot Learning spring lecture.
				The students will expand and apply the knowledge gained in the spring semester in research projects chosen jointly by the student project teams and the instructor.
				Each project will require a general understanding of robotics and machine learning as well as detailed knowledge of the particular sub-field the project operates in.
				The research conducted within each project aligns with the research directions of the  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~sniekum/research.php">Personal Autonomous Robotics Lab</a> and ideally leads to or supports a publication in a major robotics / machine learning conference.
				Students grow into productive researchers, working on real robot platforms in an actual robot learning research group.
				presenting challenges, experiences and rewards that differ significantly from most undergraduate classes.
			</p>


			<p><b>Organization</b>
			Class sessions will be held in PHR 2.114 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 15:30 to 17:00 if not announced otherwise.
			Attendance is mandatory.
			Students are expected to email the instructor in advance to inform of any potential absences.
			<br>
			The practical parts of the lecture will take place in the FRI Lab in GDC 5.710A.
			</p>

			<p> <b>Readings: </b>
			There is no textbook for this course.
			However, the following readings and online tutorials will be beneficial at different stages of the research projects.

		<div id="classtitle"> <h2> Coursework </h2> </div>
		<div id="classblock">
			<p> At the beginning of the course, project ideas will be presented by the instructor.
			Those ideas are intended as a stating point for the students to derive their own research projects from.
			The teams can of course suggest their own projects. The instructor will help do define each project such that it balances ambition with pragmatism. The students and the instructor will commit to a project idea early in the semester and the instructor will guide and support the students with the project to a reasonable degree.
			However, the students are expected to work independently and in teams on these projects.

			A sucessfull participation in this course requires a positive evaluation in all of the following milestones:
			<ol>
				<li>Project Proposal</li>
				<li>Intermediate Project Presentation</li>
				<li>Project Report</li>
				<li>Final Project Presentation</li>
			</ol>

		<div id="classtitle"> <h2> Academic honesty policy </h2> </div>
		<div id="classblock">
			<p>
			You are encouraged to discuss the readings and concepts with classmates, but all written work must be your own. Programming assignments must be your own, except for 2-person teams when teams are authorized.
		    You may <b>NOT</b> look online for existing implementations of
			algorithms related to the programming assignments, even as a reference.
			Your code will be analyzed by automatic tools that detect plagiarism to ensure that it is original.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Students caught cheating will automatically fail the course and will be reported to the university.</b>
			If in doubt about the ethics of any particular action, look at the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html#honesty">departmental
			guidelines</a> and/or ask—ignorance of the rules will not shield you from potential consequences.

		<div id="classtitle"> <h2> Notice about missed work due to religious holy days </h2> </div>
		<div id="classblock">
			<p>
			A student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project
			due to the observance of a religious holy day will be given an
			opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after
			the absence, provided that he or she has properly notified the
			instructor.  It is the policy of the University of Texas at Austin
			that the student must notify the instructor at least fourteen days
			prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to
			observe a religious holy day.  For religious holy days that fall
			within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given
			on the first day of the semester.  The student will not be penalized
			for these excused absences, but the instructor may appropriately
			respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed
			assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the excused
			absence.
