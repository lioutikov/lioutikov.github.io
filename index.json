They take up simple tasks in households, like vacuum cleaning and lawn mowing. They ensure a steady and reliable process at many work places in large scale manufacturing, like the automotive and electronics industry. Furthermore, robots are becoming more and more socially accepted, for instance as autonomous drivers. They even start to engage in special and elderly care, aiming to fill a void created by a rapidly aging population. Additionally, the increasing complexity and capability of robotic systems allows to solve ever more complicated tasks in increasingly difficult scenarios and environments. Soon, encountering and interacting with robots will be considered as natural as interacting with other humans.\nHowever, when it comes to defining and understanding the behavior of robots, experts are still necessary. Robots usually follow predefined routines which are programmed and tuned by people with years of experience. Unintended behavior is traced back to a certain part of the source code which can be modified using a specific programming language. Most of the people that will interact with robotic servants or coworkers in the future, will not have the necessary skill set to instruct robots in such detail. This need for an expert represents a significant bottleneck to the deployment of robots as our everyday companion in households and at work. This thesis presents several novel approaches aiming at facilitating the interaction between non-expert humans and robots in terms of intuitive instruction and simple understanding of the robot capabilities with respect to a given task.\nChapter 3 introduces a novel method that segments unlabeled demonstrations into sequence of movement primitives while simultaneously learning a movement primitive library. This method allows the non-expert to teach an entire task rather than every single primitive. Movement primitives represent a simple, atomic and commonly parameterized motion. The presented method segments each demonstration by identifying similar patterns across all demonstrations and treating them as samples drawn from a learned probabilistic representation of a movement primitive. The method is formulated as an expectation-maximization approach and was evaluated in several tasks,including a chair assembly and segmenting table tennis demonstrations.\nIn Chapter 4 the previously segmented demonstrations and the learned primitive library are used to induce a formal grammar for movements. Formal grammars are a well established concept in formal language theory and have been applied in several fields, reaching from linguistics, over compiler architecture to robotics. The simplest class of grammars, regular grammars, correspond in their probabilistic form to Hidden Markov Models. However, the intuitive, hierarchical representation of transitions as a set of rules makes it easier for non-experts to comprehend the possible behaviors the grammar implies. A sequence of movements can now be considered a sentence produced by the learned grammar. The production of each sentence can be illustrated by a tree structure, allowing an easy understanding of the involved rules. Probabilistic context-free grammars are a superset of regular grammars and, hence, are more expressive and exceed the capabilities of Hidden Markov Models. While the induction of probabilistic context-free grammars is considered a difficult, unsolved problem for natural languages, the observed sequences of movement primitives show much simpler structures, making the induction more feasible. The method was successfully evaluated on several tasks, such as a pick-and-place task in a tic-tac-toe setting or a handover task in a collaborative tool box assembly.\nChapter 5 introduces the concept of reinforcement learning into the domain of formal grammars. Given an objective, we apply a natural policy gradient approach in order to learn the grammar parameters that produces sequences of primitives that solve that objective. This allows the autonomous improvement of robot behavior. For instance, a cleaning up task can be optimized for efficiency while avoiding self collisions. The parameters of the grammar are the probabilities of each production. Therefore, probability constraints have to be maintained while learning the parameters. The applied natural policy gradient method ensures reasonably small parameter updates, such that the grammar probabilities change gradually. We derive the natural policy gradient method for formal grammars and evaluate the method on several tasks.\nTogether, the individual contributions presented in this thesis form an imitation learning pipeline that facilitates the instruction, interaction and collaboration with robots. Starting from unlabeled demonstrations, an underlying movement primitive library is learned while simultaneously segmenting the given demonstrations into sequences of primitives. These sequences are than used to induce a formal grammar. The structure of the grammar and the produced parse trees form a comprehensible representation of the robot capabilities with respect to the demonstrated task. Finally, a reinforcement learning approach allows the autonomous optimization of the grammar given an objective.","tags":null,"title":"Parsing Motion and Composing Behavior for Semi-Autonomous Manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

However, these methods often require a hand-coded cost function in order to achieve the desired behavior. Specifying such cost function for a complex desired behavior, e.g., disentangling a rope, is a non-trivial task that is often even infeasible. Learning from demonstration (LfD) methods offer an alternative way to program robot motion. LfD methods are less dependent on analytical models and instead learn the behavior of experts implicitly from the demonstrated trajectories. However, the problem of adapting the demonstrations to new situations, e.g., avoiding newly introduced obstacles, has not been fully investigated in the literature. In this paper, we present a motion planning framework that combines the advantages of optimization-based and demonstration-based methods. We learn a distribution of trajectories demonstrated by human experts and use it to guide the trajectory optimization process. The resulting trajectory maintains the demonstrated behaviors, which are essential to performing the task successfully,while adapting the trajectory to avoid obstacles. In simulated experiments and with a real robotic system, we verify that our approach optimizes the trajectory to avoid obstacles and encodes the demonstrated behavior in the resulting trajectory.","tags":null,"title":"Guiding Trajectory Optimization by Demonstrated Distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

While the primitives themselves have been extensively researched, the concept of movement primitive libraries has not received similar attention. Libraries of movement primitives represent the skill set of an agent. Primitives can be queried and sequenced in order to solve specific tasks. The goal of this work is to segment unlabeled demonstrations into a representative set of primitives. Our proposed method differs from current approaches by taking advantage of the often neglected,mutual dependencies between the segments contained in the demonstrations and the primitives to be encoded. By exploiting this mutual dependency, we show that we can improve both the segmentation and the movement primitive library. Based on probabilistic inference our novel approach segments the demonstrations while learning a probabilistic representation of movement primitives. We demonstrate our method on two real robot applications. First, the robot segments sequences of different letters into a library, explaining the observed trajectories.

The method allows the progress, also referred to as the phase of the movement,to be estimated even when observations of the human are partial and occluded; a problem typically found when using motion capture systems in cluttered environments. By leveraging on the framework of Interaction Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs), phase estimation makes it possible to classify the human action, and to generate a corresponding robot trajectory before the human finishes his/her movement. The method is therefore suited for semi-autonomous robots acting as assistants and coworkers. Since observations may be sparse, our method is based on computing the probability of different phase candidates to find the phase that best aligns the Interaction ProMP with the current observations. The method is fundamentally different from approaches based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that must rely on a consistent stream of measurements at runtime. The phase estimation algorithm can be seamlessly integrated into Interaction ProMPs such that robot trajectory coordination, phase estimation, and action recognition can all be achieved in a single probabilistic framework. We evaluated the method using a 7-DoF lightweight robot arm equipped with a 5-finger hand in single and multi-task collaborative experiments.

This paper combines Bayesian task  prioritization  with  probabilistic  movement  primitives  to prioritize  full  motion  sequences  that  are  learned  from  demonstrations.   Probabilistic   movement   primitives   (ProMPs)   can encode  distributions  of  movements  over  full  motion  sequences and  provide  control  laws  to  exactly  follow  these  distributions.The probabilistic formulation allows for a natural application of Bayesian task prioritization.

In particular, intelligent robotic co-workers should not only mimic human demonstrations but should also be able to adapt them to varying application scenarios. As such,robots must have the ability to generalize motions to different workspaces, e.g. to avoid obstacles not present during original demonstrations. Towards this goal our work proposes a unified method to (1) generalize robot motions to different workspaces,using a novel formulation of trajectory optimization that explicitly incorporates human demonstrations, and (2) to locally adapt and reuse the optimized solution in the form of a distribution of trajectories. This optimized distribution can be used, online, to quickly satisfy via-points and goals of a specific task. We validate the method using a 7 degrees of freedom (DoF)lightweight arm that grasps and places a ball into different boxes while avoiding obstacles that were not present during the original human demonstrations.","tags":null,"title":"Demonstration Based Trajectory Optimization for Generalizable Robot Motions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Predictive robot behavior is a desired characteristic of robot collaborators that lead to fluid and faster interactions. We are particularly interested in improving reactive methods that rely on human action recognition to activate a corresponding robot movement. Action recognition invariably causes delay in the robot’s response, and the goal of our method is to minimize this delay by predicting the next human action and pre-triggering the corresponding robot motions. The prediction is achieved by using a lookup table containing variations of assembly sequences, previously demonstrated by different users.The method uses the nearest neighbor sequence in the table that matches the actual sequence of human actions. At the movement level, our method uses a probabilistic representation of interaction primitives to generate the robot trajectories. The method is demonstrated using a 7 degree-of-freedom lightweight(DoF) arm equipped with a 5-finger hand on an assembly task consisting of 17 steps.","tags":null,"title":"Proactive Human-Robot Collaboration with Interaction Primitives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

The method aims at generating a collaborative trajectory of the robot as a function of the current action of the human. The trajectory generation is based on action recognition and prediction of the human movement given intermittent observations of his/her positions under unknown speeds of execution;a problem typically found when using motion capture systems in scenarios that lead to occlusion. Of particular interest, the ability to predict the human movement while observing the initial part of his/her trajectory allows for faster robot reactions, and as it will be shown, also eliminates the need of time-alignment of the training data. The method models the coupling be-tween human-robot movement primitives and is scalable in relation to the number of tasks. We evaluated the method using a 7-DoF lightweight robot arm equipped with a 5-finger hand in a multi-task collaborative assembly experiment, also comparing results with our previous method based on time-aligned trajectories.","tags":null,"title":"A Probabilistic Framework for Semi-Autonomous Robots Based on Interaction Primitives with Phase Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Such a form of learning can be achieved by demonstrations and imitation. A recently introduced method to learn interactions from demonstrations is the framework of Interaction Primitives. While this framework is limited to represent and generalize a single interaction pattern, in practice, interactions between a human and a robot can consist of many different patterns. To overcome this limitation this paper proposes a Mixture of Interaction Primitives to learn multiple interaction patterns from unlabeled demonstrations.Specifically the proposed method uses Gaussian Mixture Mod-els of Interaction Primitives to model nonlinear correlations between the movements of the different agents. We validate our algorithm with two experiments involving interactive tasks between a human and a lightweight robotic arm. In the first,we compare our proposed method with conventional Interaction Primitives in a toy problem scenario where the robot and the human are not linearly correlated. In the second, we present a proof-of-concept experiment where the robot assists a human in assembling a box.","tags":null,"title":"Learning Multiple Collaborative Tasks with a Mixture of Interaction Primitives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

Due to their ease of use and their generality, they have recently also gained a lot of attention in operations research, machine learning and policy search. Yet, these algorithms require a lot of evaluations of the objective, scale poorly with the problem dimension, are affected by highly noisy objective functions and may converge prematurely. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a new surrogate-based stochastic search approach. We learn simple, quadratic surrogate models of the objective function.As the quality of such a quadratic approximation is limited, we do not greedily exploit the learned models. The algorithm can be misled by an inaccurate optimum introduced by the surrogate. Instead, we use information theoretic constraints to bound the ‘distance’ between the new and old data distribution while maximizing the objective function. Additionally the new method is able to sustain the exploration of the search distribution to avoid premature convergence. We compare our method with state of art black-box optimization methods on standard unimodal and multi-modal optimization functions, on simulated planar robot tasks and a complex robot ball throwing task.

While the primitives themselves have been extensively researched, the concept of movement primitive libraries has not received as much attention. Libraries of movement primitives represent the skill set of an agent and can be queried and sequenced in order to solve specific tasks. The goal of this work is to segment unlabeled demonstrations into an optimal set of skills. Our novel approach segments the demonstrations while learning a probabilistic representation of movement primitives. The method differs from current approaches by taking advantage of the often neglected, mutual dependencies between the segments contained in the demonstrations and the primitives to be encoded. Therefore, improving the combined quality of both segmentation and skill learning. Furthermore, our method allows incorporating domain specific insights using heuristics, which are subsequently evaluated and assessed through probabilistic inference methods. We demonstrate our method on a real robot application, where the robot segments demonstrations of a chair assembly task into a skill library.

The greedy operator does not consider such closeness constraint to the samples. Hence, the greedy operator can lead to oscillations or even instabilities in the policy updates. Such undesired behaviour is likely to result in an inferior performance of the estimated policy. We reuse inspiration from the reinforcement learning community and relax the greedy operator used in SOC with an information theoretic bound that limits the ‘distance’ of two subsequent trajectory distributions in a policy update. The introduced bound ensures a smooth and stable policy update.Our method is also well suited for model-based reinforcement learning, where we estimate the system dynamics model from data. As this model is likely to be inaccurate, it might be dangerous to exploit the model greedily. Instead, our bound ensures that we generate new data in the vicinity of the current data, such that we can improve our estimate of the system dynamics model.
